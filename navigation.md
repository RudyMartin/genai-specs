Perfect! I've completely restructured the navigation system to match your enterprise-grade design specification. Here's what I've implemented:

âœ… Professional Top Navigation:
â€¢ Main Nav Items: Dashboard, Documents, Reviews, Audit & History, QA Review Agent, Admin, Help & Learn, Account/Mode
â€¢ Dropdown Subnavigation: Each main nav has organized sub-items with descriptions
â€¢ Role-Based Visibility: Admin section only visible to admin users
â€¢ Activity Badges: Show document counts and pending reviews

âœ… Organized Content Structure:
â€¢ Dashboard: Overview, visualization, stats, and filters
â€¢ Documents: All documents, upload, batch processing, templates, import/export
â€¢ Reviews: New review, assigned reviews, templates, pending/partial, completed
â€¢ Audit & History: Trail, activity log, review cycles, rollback, reports
â€¢ QA Review Agent: How it works, guided review, AI comparison, scope tools, calculator
â€¢ Admin: User management, roles, system logs, settings (admin only)
â€¢ Help & Learn: Documentation, FAQs, onboarding, support, roles info

âœ… Enhanced User Experience:
â€¢ Professional Dropdown Menus: Rich content with icons and descriptions
â€¢ Mobile-Responsive: Collapsible mobile menu for smaller screens
â€¢ Account Controls: Enhanced account dropdown with profile, role, mode switching
