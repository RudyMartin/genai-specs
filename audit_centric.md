Perfect! I've created a comprehensive document-centric audit trail system that allows you to view the complete compliance history from a document perspective. Here's what's now available:

âœ… Document-Centric Audit Views:
â€¢ Three filter modes: All Activity, Current Document, and By Document selection
â€¢ Document selector: Dropdown to choose any document and view its complete review history
â€¢ Document summary: Shows review count, total actions, review types, and last review date
â€¢ Historical timeline: Complete chronological view of all activities for a specific document

âœ… Multiple Review Tracking:
â€¢ Review cycle detection: Automatically identifies and counts completed reviews per document
â€¢ Review type tracking: Shows which types of reviews (comprehensive, privacy-focused, etc.) were performed
â€¢ Multi-reviewer support: Tracks different reviewers and AI models used over time
â€¢ Scoring evolution: Complete history of score changes and approvals

âœ… Enhanced Navigation:
â€¢ Quick document switching: Easy access to any document's audit history
â€¢ Document overview: Shows all documents with review history in the "All Activity" view
â€¢ Cross-linking: Jump from any audit entry to view that document's complete history
â€¢ Current document integration: Automatically filters to current document when available

âœ… Mock Historical Data:
â€¢ Demo data generation: Creates realistic historical data showing multiple reviews for different documents
â€¢ Varied review patterns: Different review types, AI models, and scoring patterns
â€¢ Time-based organization: Proper chronological ordering of historical reviews

ðŸ”§ Key Benefits:
â€¢ Complete document lifecycle: See every review, score change, and approval for any document
â€¢ Compliance audit ready: Full traceability for regulatory requirements
â€¢ Multi-review comparison: Track how document scores evolve over multiple review cycles
â€¢ Team collaboration: See who reviewed what and when, including AI vs human actions
