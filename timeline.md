# MVP1: Automated Text Intelligence Agents
## 🎯 Objective: Deploy two text-based agents that accelerate operational workflows

* **Agent 1:** 📄 **Documentation Preview Agent** – surface summaries, issues, and flags from risk-related documents.
* **Agent 2:** 🛠️ **Jira Support Triage Agent** – route, tag, and comment on tickets based on historical and contextual patterns.
