Here is a summary of the brand guidelines  regarding colors and fonts:

**Colors:**

- **Primary Palette (Basic):**  
  - Dark Green: #05341D  
  - Off-white: #EDEBE9  
  - Blue: #085280  
  - White: #FFFFFF  
  - Dark Neutral: #121212  

- **Extended Palette:**  
  - Burnt Orange: #C55422  
  - Teal: #238196  

- **Third Level Colors:**  
  - Mustard Yellow: #FFB400  
  - Forest Green: #2C6937  
  - Deep Magenta: #911A5B  

- **Color Usage Restrictions:**  
  - Avoid altering or adding unauthorized colors  
  - Do not place white type on tints or light colors (for legibility)  
  - Do not use gradients  
  - Avoid overly dark or saturated color effects or layering  
  - Do not use secondary colors for small details  

**Fonts:**

- **Headers:** Use "Glypha" and "San Source Pro" fonts

These guidelines help maintain brand consistency by defining the exact colors and typography styles, as well as restricting improper color usage and combinations such as unauthorized colors, gradients, or poor legibility choices.

This combination of distinct primary, extended, and third-level color palettes with clear font assignments for headers and body text will ensure visual harmony and brand recognition across all platforms.
