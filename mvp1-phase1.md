I'll implement the high-impact Phase 1 features that will immediately improve user productivity:

Batch Document Upload - Allow users to upload multiple documents at once with progress tracking
Bulk Operations on Documents - Multi-select documents with bulk actions (approve, delete, assign)
Review Templates - Pre-configured templates for common review scenarios
Auto-save for Reviews - Prevent data loss by saving progress automatically

These features will significantly streamline the workflow and reduce repetitive tasks. I'll start with the batch upload functionality since it's the most requested feature.
