```
High-Risk Documents (>8/10 risk score):
├── AI generates initial review
├── Human validates and enhances
└── Human makes final decisions

Medium-Risk Documents (4-7/10 risk score):
├── AI generates complete review
├── Human spot-checks (sampling)
└── AI escalates anomalies

Low-Risk Documents (<4/10 risk score):
├── AI generates complete review
├── Automated approval (if no findings)
└── Human oversight through dashboards
```

- **Industry Benchmark Comparison**: Flag deviations from industry standards
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detect concerning language patterns and tone shifts

### 3.2 Dynamic Scope Management
**Current**: Static scope assignments
**Target**: AI-driven dynamic scope allocation based on risk profiles

**Implementation**:
- Real-time scope adjustment based on document complexity
- Automatic escalation pathways for high-risk findings
- Load balancing between human experts and AI processing
- Continuous calibration of risk thresholds
